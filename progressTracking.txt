- used the intal grid to find a distribution of UCXBs
    - found values of primary and secondary
    - made a grid of 100k where min primary was 6 <x< 20 and secondary 4<x<10
    - this grid only retuned 73 UCXBs, not enough to draw any conclusions
    - rurunning with a million systems in hopes of getting enough for a normal distribution, which can then be used to make a finer grid
        - this grid finished, showed some interesting results. I realized that I had a much different max time then the previous grid, resulting in the donor stars properties being captured in the final state being much different
        - also discovered 9 NS_WD contacts, which is neat, and I cant believe are actually a real thing lol
    
    - Lot of discoveries! 
        - The data seems to be showing that in every single UCXB the RLO happens with the donor being a non burning stripped hydrogen star.

        - There appears to be a pretty linear relationship between S2 init and final masses!!!!
        - Old data seems to be really really wrong 
        -New data evoles MUCH faster
        - Also, it seems like there is two distributions in S2 init masses, one centered between 5-8 and another between 9-10. Bit worried that this distribution is being cut off by the simulation having a max s2 mass of 10, but needs further investegation
        - Star one inital mass seems to be very very very strongly cented around a little under 8...
