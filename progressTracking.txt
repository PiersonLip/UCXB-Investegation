- used the intal grid to find a distribution of UCXBs
    - found values of primary and secondary
    - made a grid of 100k where min primary was 6 <x< 20 and secondary 4<x<10
    - this grid only retuned 73 UCXBs, not enough to draw any conclusions
    - rurunning with a million systems in hopes of getting enough for a normal distribution, which can then be used to make a finer grid
